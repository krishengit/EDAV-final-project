## Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, exploring variations among key gases such as Carbon Dioxide (CO₂), Methane (CH₄), Nitrous Oxide (N₂O), and fluorinated gases (F-gases). The analysis includes emissions trends over time, sectoral contributions, and country-specific patterns from 1990 to 2020.

The insights gained from this project aim to support data-driven policymaking and global climate action by identifying key contributors and trends in GHG emissions.

Further introduction and data source initial exploration are provided in the [index.qmd](https://github.com/krishengit/EDAV-final-project/blob/main/index.qmd)  and [data.qmd](https://github.com/krishengit/EDAV-final-project/blob/main/data.qmd) file.
