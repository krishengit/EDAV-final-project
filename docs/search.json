    "text": "1 Introduction\nClimate change is among the most pressing problems today. Environmental and societal effects like extreme weather events, increasing sea levels have been augmented due to increasing proportions of green house gases and eventually global warming. Majorly carbon dioxide (CO2) is the front runner for causing increase in the average temperature of the earth.\nThis project aims to study the variations and correlations in the emissions of various greenhouse gases like Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Methane (CH4) and fluorinated gases (F-gas) over the past 3 decades (1990 - 2020). Moreover, this study aims to observe the patterns emissions of these gases across different countries across different sectors.Some of the research questions this project aims to answer are as follows:\n\nWhat are the trends in the emission of greenhouse gases over time ?\nWhich gases contribute the most to the total emissions globally and regionally ?\nWhich sectors are responsible for contributing more amount of green house gases and how do these vary across countries?\nWhich countries are contributing to the maximum amount of green house gases ?\nHow has the emissions of different gases evolved across the years across different countries and across different sectors ?\n\nUnderstanding the contributions of different gases can guide the government and policymakers in setting regulations for certain sectors and designing new policies. Moreover, insights into sector specific emissions can help these policymakers make policies targeted at reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.\nIdentifying the emissions across various countries can allow policymakers and researchers to figure out high emission countries, promote equity in climate action, tailor country specific strategies at global summits and meets and many more. Monitoring the trends of emissions of these gases would also give insights about the rate of increase or rate of decrease of emissions over the years, which is in turn crucial for countries to track their progress towards their climate goals.\nTo conclude, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights into patterns of emissions of greenhouse gases making the way for data-driven policy making. This would allow the researchers and policymakers to design strategies to tackle climate change.",

Whereas, the major contributors of CO2 have been Electricity/Heat and Energy Sectors. Moreover, over the years, the emissions of these gases have increased. Understanding these trends in these sectors can help policy makers develop effective measures to control emissions and adopt sustainable practices.\n\nIn this plot we analyze the trends of emission of different gases in different countries in different sectors.\n\n\n\nCode\ngas_focused &lt;- subset(\n  data_long,\n  Country %in% c(\"China\", \"United States\", \"India\", \"European Union (27)\", \"Russia\") &\n    Sector %in% c(\"Energy\", \"Agriculture\", \"Transport\", \"Electricity/Heat\") &\n    Gas %in% c(\"CO2\", \"CH4\", \"N2O\")\n)\n\n\nggplot(gas_focused, aes(x = Year, y = Emissions, color = Country)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  facet_grid(Sector ~ Gas, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log10', labels = scales::comma) +  # Log-transform the y-axis\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sectoral Emissions by Gas and Country (1990–2021)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Emissions (Log Scale)\",\n    color = \"Country\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina and United States are the primary emitters of CO2 mainly in the Energy and Electricity/ Heat Sectors. Further, The European Union suggests a stable trend in the emission of CO2, with sector agriculture showing a downward trend in the emission of CH4 and N2O. Russia also displays a similar trend India leads the emission of CH4 particularly in the agriculture sector. This can be attributed to the large number of agricultural activities carried out in India. United States also displays a stable trend in agriculture sector and slight downward trend in the Electricity and Energy sector.\n\nSectoral Emissions across countries in 2021 or CO2\n\n\n\nCode\nsector_country_data &lt;- subset(\n  data_long,\n  Year == 2021 &\n    Country %in% c(\n      \"China\", \"United States\", \"India\", \"European Union (27)\",\n      \"Russia\", \"Japan\", \"Brazil\", \"Germany\"\n    ) &\n    Gas == \"CO2\" &\n    !Sector %in% c(\"Total including LUCF\", \"Total excluding LUCF\")  # Exclude these sectors\n)\n\nggplot(sector_country_data, aes(x = Country, y = Sector, fill = Emissions)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"darkblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sectoral Emissions Across Countries (2021)\",\n    x = \"Country\",\n    y = \"Sector\",\n    fill = \"Emissions (MtCO₂e)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot informs us about the emissions of each country with respect to a particular sector.

Sectors like Agriculture, Fugitive emissions and waste contribute to the emissions of CH4. Further Agriculture and Industrial sectors are responsible for the emissions of N2O gas.

    "text": "In conclusion, our analysis of global greenhouse gas emissions shows a multidimensional picture of changing emission trends by various sectors in different countries over the years. Firstly, even though CO2 continues to dominate the global emissions, F-gas emissions have increased over the years raising concerns about more sources of emissions apart from the existing CO2 sources. Whereas gases like CH4 and N2O have also seen rise in the emission levels, but their increase doesn’t seem to be as alarming as that of CO2 and F-gas. Further, delving into to sector wise analysis helps us realize that Energy and Electricity/Heat sectors have been the front runners in the emissions of CO2. While the agriculture sector is the major source of CH4 and N2O which can be attributed to activities related to livestock. These observations call for the need to adapt and shift to sustainable practices such as increasing the usage of renewable energy systems, adopting practices in agriculture that reduce emissions of methane and producing electricity in an efficient manner. Recognizing these trends would help the policymakers, leaders and researchers develop techniques to reduce the overall emission of these gases, progress towards the goal of Net Zero Carbon emission, incentivize climate friendly and sustainable practices. Moreover, shifting the lens to country-level emission trends we see that some nations have seen a steep rise in the amount of emissions over the years, while some have displayed a stable pattern and others showing a gradual decline in the emissions. Specifically, China, United States and India have been among the top emitters of these gases in 2021. Over the years, China has seen a steep rise in the emissions of these gases, mainly CO2, while India showing a gradual rise and United States have displayed stable patterns. Countries in the European Union have observed a decline in the emission of all the gases in some major sectors over the years except F-gas, which has increased gradually. To conclude, as the emission trends emerge, data collection and analysis of these trends will be crucial in the future to track the emissions and monitor the progress towards net zero target and developing sustainable practices. Moreover, these emissions call for global efforts to make collective efforts and adopt best practices to progress towards more sustainable future.",
