    "text": "1 Introduction\nClimate change is among the most pressing problems today. Environmental and societal effects like extreme weather events, increasing sea levels have been augmented due to increasing proportions of green house gases and eventually global warming. Majorly carbon dioxide (CO2) is the front runner for causing increase in the average temperature of the earth.\nThis project aims to study the variations and correlations in the emissions of various greenhouse gases like Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Methane (CH4) and fluorinated gases (F-gas) over the past 3 decades (1990 - 2020). Moreover, this study aims to observe the patterns emissions of these gases across different countries across different sectors.Some of the research questions this project aims to answer are as follows:\n\nWhat are the trends in the emission of greenhouse gases over time ?\nWhich gases contribute the most to the total emissions globally and regionally ?\nWhich sectors are responsible for contributing more amount of green house gases and how do these vary across countries?\nWhich countries are contributing to the maximum amount of green house gases ?\nHow has the emissions of different gases evolved across the years across different countries and across different sectors ?\n\nUnderstanding the contributions of different gases can guide the government and policymakers in setting regulations for certain sectors and designing new policies. Moreover, insights into sector specific emissions can help these policymakers make policies targeted at reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.\nIdentifying the emissions across various countries can allow policymakers and researchers to figure out high emission countries, promote equity in climate action, tailor country specific strategies at global summits and meets and many more. Monitoring the trends of emissions of these gases would also give insights about the rate of increase or rate of decrease of emissions over the years, which is in turn crucial for countries to track their progress towards their climate goals.\nTo conclude, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights into patterns of emissions of greenhouse gases making the way for data-driven policy making. This would allow the researchers and policymakers to design strategies to tackle climate change.",

The dataset tracks emission of greenhouse gases across different sectors and gases over time, allowing for a detailed analysis of historical trends. The dataset has the following categorical variales and contionous variables:\nCategorical Variables: Country (ISO, Country), data source, sector, gas type, and unit.\nContinuous Variables: Yearly emissions values (1990–2021).\nDimensions: 8,214 rows x 37 columns.\nFrequency of Updates: Likely annual.\nIssues: Missing values for earlier years and specific sectors. Moroever, the data is aggregated at varying levels (like global, country, sector, gases) which may filtering for specific analysis.",

Whereas, the major contributors of CO2 have been Electricity/Heat and Energy Sectors. Moreover, over the years, the emissions of these gases have increased. Understanding these trends in these sectors can help policy makers develop effective measures to control emissions and adopt sustainable practices.\n\nIn this plot we analyze the trends of emission of different gases in different countries in different sectors.\n\n\n\nCode\ngas_focused &lt;- subset(\n  data_long,\n  Country %in% c(\"China\", \"United States\", \"India\", \"European Union (27)\", \"Russia\") &\n    Sector %in% c(\"Energy\", \"Agriculture\", \"Transport\", \"Electricity/Heat\") &\n    Gas %in% c(\"CO2\", \"CH4\", \"N2O\")\n)\n\n\nggplot(gas_focused, aes(x = Year, y = Emissions, color = Country)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  facet_grid(Sector ~ Gas, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sectoral Emissions by Gas and Country (1990–2021)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Emissions (MtCO₂e)\",\n    color = \"Country\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina and United States are the primary emitters of CO2 mainly in the Energy and Electricity/ Heat Sectors. Further, The European Union suggests a stable trend in the emission of CO2, with sector agriculture showing a downward trend in the emission of CH4 and N2O. Russia also displays a similar trend India leads the emission of CH4 particularly in the agriculture sector. This can be attributed to the large number of agricultural activities carried out in India. United States also displays a stable trend in agriculture sector and slight downward trend in the Electricity and Energy sector.\n\nSectoral Emissions across countries in 2021 or CO2\n\n\n\nCode\nsector_country_data &lt;- subset(\n  data_long,\n  Year == 2021 &\n    Country %in% c(\n      \"China\", \"United States\", \"India\", \"European Union (27)\",\n      \"Russia\", \"Japan\", \"Brazil\", \"Germany\"\n    ) &\n    Gas == \"CO2\" &\n    !Sector %in% c(\"Total including LUCF\", \"Total excluding LUCF\")  # Exclude these sectors\n)\n\nggplot(sector_country_data, aes(x = Country, y = Sector, fill = Emissions)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"darkblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sectoral Emissions Across Countries (2021)\",\n    x = \"Country\",\n    y = \"Sector\",\n    fill = \"Emissions (MtCO₂e)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot informs us about the emissions of each country with respect to a particular sector. This also tells us how active that country would be in that sector. As we observed from the previous graphs, Energy and Electricity/Heat are the top emitters. Couple of countries have high amount of emission in the transportation and manufacturing/construction.\n\nHere we analyze the sectoral emissions by gas which a plot between two categorical varibles and thus we use a stacked bar chart.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Filter \nsector_gas_data &lt;- subset(\n  data_long,\n  Year == 2021 &\n    !Sector %in% c(\"Total including LUCF\", \"Total excluding LUCF\") &\n    Gas %in% c(\"CO2\", \"CH4\", \"N2O\", \"F-Gas\")\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsector_gas_summary &lt;- sector_gas_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Sector, Gas) |&gt;\n  summarise(Total_Emissions = sum(Emissions, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Sector'.

Sectors like Agriculture, Fugitive emissions and waste contribute to the emissions of CH4. Further Agriculture and Industrial sectors are responsible for the emissions of N2O gas. And Industrial processes are the major contributors of F-Gas.\n\nIn this plot we finally analyze the percentage contribution of the top 5 CO2 emitting countries over the years.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Filter CO2 emissions data\nco2_data &lt;- data_long |&gt;\n  filter(Gas == \"CO2\", Sector == \"Total including LUCF\")\n\n# Calculate global total emissions for each year\nglobal_emissions &lt;- co2_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarise(Total_Emissions = sum(Emissions, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Calculate cumulative emissions per country and identify top 5 emitters\ntop_5_countries &lt;- co2_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Country) |&gt;\n  summarise(Cumulative_Emissions = sum(Emissions, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Cumulative_Emissions)) |&gt;\n  slice(2:6) |&gt;\n  pull(Country)\n\n# Filter for top 5 countries and calculate percentage contribution\ntop_5_contributions &lt;- co2_data |&gt;\n  filter(Country %in% top_5_countries) |&gt;\n  left_join(global_emissions, by = \"Year\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Percentage_Contribution = Emissions / Total_Emissions * 100)\n\n# Plot the line chart\nggplot(top_5_contributions, aes(x = Year, y = Percentage_Contribution, color = Country)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Contribution of Top 5 Countries to CO2 Emissions (1990–2021)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Percentage Contribution\",\n    color = \"Country\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that the percentage contribution of China has increased significantly over the years. The same trend is observed for India but the rise is gradual and is not as steep as China. Whereas, for the countries in European Union, United States and Brazil, the contribution of CO2 has fallen over the years.",
